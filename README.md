- **Adminer**: `http://localhost:8081`

## 🔍 Additional Tools

### Redis

Redis is included in this stack for caching and session management. To use Redis, connect to it using your preferred Redis client.

### Composer

Composer is installed for dependency management in PHP projects. You can run Composer commands inside the PHP container.

### Node.js

Node.js is included for projects that require JavaScript on the server side. Install any necessary packages with `npm` or `yarn`.
